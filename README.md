## Why?

When you run your scripts with `yarn run` command, Yarn doesn't load environment variables from `.env` file. This is creating some discomfort when you need use `dotenv` externally when yarn can do it. With this plugin you not need use it anymore. Just add your environment variables to `.env` file and run your scripts with `yarn run <script>` or `yarn <script>` commands. If you want to use environment variables in your code, you can use `process.env` object. If you want to watch environment variables which will be used in your script, define `NODE_ENV` and call `yarn env` command or just call `yarn env --env <NODE_ENV>` command for specific situations. It defines `NODE_ENV` automatically if not defined yet.
